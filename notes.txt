Comment: A quick note on the 30 auto-awarded points for dcat_ap_ch_conformity:

This specific indicator is designed to check if the dataset's metadata is 100% compliant with the official Swiss DCAT-AP-CH specification. This is a very complex validation that requires a dedicated "SHACL" validator, which is not part of this script's simple checks (we mainly check for presence of keys and if URLs work).

Because we don't perform this deep check, we auto-award the 30 points. This matches the behavior of the data_loader repository we based this on, which hardcodes this value to True, and ensures we don't unfairly lower a dataset's score.
