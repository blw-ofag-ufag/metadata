Welcome to the **FOAG Metadata** repository! Here, you'll find the metadata files that describe various datasets of ours, the Python automation script responsible for merging and validating our metadata files, as well as the JSON Schemas that ensure each record follows a consistent format. Under `data/processed`, we store the combined metadata ready for use in the FOAG Data Catalog. This setup helps maintain high-quality, well-structured metadata that is compatible with both [I14Y](https://www.i14y.admin.ch/) and [opendata.swiss](https://opendata.swiss).

The metadata you find here is displayed in a more user-friendly way by our [data catalog](https://github.com/blw-ofag-ufag/data-catalog) web application.
